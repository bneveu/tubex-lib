The following example is taken from `this paper <http://simon-rohou.fr/research/tubeval/tubeval_paper.pdf>`_.

Details are coming soon.

To run the example, launch the Vibes viewer and, from a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

  ./build/examples/cpp/06_lowcost_beacons/ex_lowcost_beacons

The sources are available in:

.. code-block:: none
